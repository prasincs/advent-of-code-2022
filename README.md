Advent of Code 2022 in Rust

I did this to learn some advanced things in rust to get my skills up. I didn't have quite as much bandwidth every day to work on things - so so parts may have been inspired by other solutions, I usually attribute when I can in comments but sorry if I missed, I used this as learning exercise and I hope someone else can use my repo as one too.
